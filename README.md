# Reach Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is me running through the [reach tutorial](https://docs.reach.sh/tut/rps/) and trying to keep a barebones repo to maintain all that.

If you want to read my thoughts as I'm going through it, check out the source
and you can read a collection of thoughts here:

## Notes

If you want to run this code, you'll have to have Reach installed and running.
I'm running it in Docker, as per the normal instructions.
